# 1s long evaluation demos for rectangular masks

this document only includes some 1-second long evaluation demos for rectangular masks, whose size is from 10% to 30% in both time and frequency dimension. Speech signals are randomly selected from LibriSpeech dev-clean dataset. Ground truth, masked, and inpainted spectrums for each mask size are saved as images. Besides, their audio files are also included. Masks are randomly generated according to rules detailed in proposed paper. Inpainted results are  magnitude outputs of proposed GAN model, with masked signals as input.
