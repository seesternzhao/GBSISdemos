# GBSISdemos
This document provides some demos of our GAN based speech inpainting system. Currently, this document only includes some 1-second long evaluation demos of GAN model for mask size from 10% to 40% in both time and frequency dimensions. More long speech demos of inpainting system will be updated soon, after Covid-19 pandemic control policies in Shenzhen, China  are adjusted. Because we have to work at home, and can not access companyâ€™s data system now, due to the Covid-19 pandemic control policies.


256 samples STFT used to keep consistent with previous methods for evaluation and comparison. However, 256 samples limit the resolution along the frequency dimension, which also limits inpainting performance and hearing. Therefore, Demos shown here are all based 512 samples STFT. The intermediate results of proposed system in our paper is also updated as following:
