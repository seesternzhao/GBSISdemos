# GBSISdemos
This document provides some demos of our GAN based speech inpainting system. This document includes some long demos and some 1-second long evaluation demos for mask size from 10% to 40% in both time and frequency dimensions. 

In addition, 256 samples STFT used to keep consistent with previous methods for the evaluation and comparison. However, 256 samples limit the resolution along the frequency dimension, which further limits inpainting performance and hearing. Therefore, Demos shown here are all based 512 samples STFT. The intermediate results of proposed system in our paper is also updated as following:
