# 1s long evaluation demos

Some 1-second long evaluation demos for proposed GAN based speech inpainting model with masks size from 10% to 40% in both time and frequency dimension are provided here. Speech signals are randomly selected from LibriSpeech dev-clean dataset. Ground truth, masked, and inpainted spectrums for each speech signal are saved as images. Besides, their audio files are also included. Masks are randomly generated according to rules detailed in proposed paper.
