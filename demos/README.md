# Long Demos of proposed GAN based speech inpainting system

This document includes some long demos. These speech signals are randomly selected from the LibriSpeech dev-clean dataset. Ground truth, masked, inpainted, and inpainted with initial phase are provided for each speech signal. Masks, whose size is from 10% to 40% in both time and frequency dimension, are randomly generated according to rules detailed in the proposed paper. Inpainted results are  magnitude outputs of proposed GAN model, with masked signals as input.
