# Long Demos of proposed GAN based speech inpainting system
Here provide some long demos. These speech signals are randomly selected from the LibriSpeech dev-clean dataset. Ground truth, masked, inpainted, and inpainted with initial phase are provided for each speech signal. The outputs of the proposed system are saved in "inpainted". Additional results (inpainted with original phase) are saved in "initialphase". Masks, whose size is from 10% to 40% for each second in both time and frequency dimension, are randomly generated according to rules detailed in the proposed paper.
